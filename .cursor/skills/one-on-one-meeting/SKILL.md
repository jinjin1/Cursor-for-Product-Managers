  Processes and organizes 1:1 meeting notes with structured format. Use when sharing
  notes from one-on-one meetings to save them in organized Markdown format with
  action items tracking.
---

# Process
1. Save notes in a Markdown file named after the person (e.g., `JohnDoe.md`) inside `/1-1 notes/`.
2. If the file already exists, append the new meeting notes **at the top of the file**, so that the most recent meeting is always first.
3. Use the following format for each meeting:

   ## [YYYY-MM-DD]
   ### Notes
   - Key discussion points here
   ### Action Items
   - [ ] Task 1 (assigned to me)  
   - [ ] Task 2 (assigned to me)

4. Do **not** add action items that belong to others.
