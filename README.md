# Cursor for Product Managers

Transform Cursor into your AI-native product management copilot. Stop wrestling with fragmented PM tools and start building a unified, AI-powered workspace for user research, product strategy, OKR planning, PRD creation, and discovery workflows — all powered by proven frameworks like Continuous Discovery Habits, PRISM, and Evidence-Guided product development.

Originally inspired by the [Maven course on AI-native PMs](https://maven.com/p/0a96cb/cursor-isn-t-just-for-coding-how-ai-native-p-ms-work), [AI Dev Tasks](https://github.com/snarktank/ai-dev-tasks/tree/main), and [Lee Robinson's demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QN23ZThdRY).

## Why This Toolkit?

Product management involves complex workflows across research, discovery, and delivery. This toolkit brings structure, clarity, and AI-native efficiency to the process:

1. **Unified Context Management** — Centralize all PM knowledge, frameworks, and insights in one AI-accessible workspace
2. **Structured Discovery** — Run systematic user research with Continuous Discovery Habits (Teresa Torres) built in
3. **AI-Native Workflows** — Create PRDs, 1-pagers, design briefs, and strategy reviews through natural conversation
4. **Iterative Improvement** — Documents and insights grow smarter with every AI interaction

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository into your Cursor workspace
2. Open Cursor Agent chat and start with a workflow:

| What you want to do | Just type |
|:---------------------|:----------|
| Process interview transcripts | `/create-interview-snapshots` |
| Create a PRD | `/create-prd` |
| Review product strategy (PRISM) | `/product-strategy-review` |
| Start a new initiative | `/setup-initiative` |
| Run full discovery research | `/discovery-researcher` |

Skills are automatically discovered — no configuration needed.

## What You Can Do

### User Research & Discovery

Run the full Continuous Discovery Habits workflow, from raw interview data to testable assumptions:

```
Interview data → /create-interview-snapshots → /synthesize-snapshots
→ /create-opportunities → /generate-solutions → /identify-test-assumptions
```

Or let the `/discovery-researcher` subagent run the entire flow for you.

| Skill | What it does |
|:------|:-------------|
| `/create-interview-snapshots` | Extract structured snapshots from qualitative interviews |
| `/synthesize-snapshots` | Find patterns and themes across multiple interviews |
| `/create-opportunities` | Build an Opportunity Solution Tree (OST) |
| `/generate-solutions` | AI-human collaborative solution ideation |
| `/identify-test-assumptions` | Surface and test leap-of-faith assumptions |

### Product Documents

Create professional product artifacts through guided conversation:

| Skill | What it does |
|:------|:-------------|
| `/create-prd` | Generate Product Requirements Documents with clarifying questions |
| `/create-one-pager` | Amazon-style decision-focused 1-Pagers |
| `/create-design-brief` | Design briefs in JSON + Markdown |
| `/generate-figma-prompt` | Figma Make-ready prompts (5000 char limit) |

### Product Strategy & OKRs

Review and refine your strategic direction with proven frameworks:

| Skill | What it does |
|:------|:-------------|
| `/product-strategy-review` | PRISM framework: Problem Diagnosis, Reframe, Intentional Bets, Systemized Execution, Momentum |
| `/product-vision-review` | Evaluate vision on 4 criteria: Lofty, Realistic, Constraint-Free, User-Grounded |
| `/okr-sparring-partner` | Context-aware OKR coaching and sparring partner |
| `/calculate-ice-score` | ICE prioritization scoring (Impact x Confidence x Ease) |

### Task Management

Break strategy into execution:

| Skill | What it does |
|:------|:-------------|
| `/generate-tasks` | Break PRDs into actionable, granular task lists |

### Meetings & Writing

| Skill | What it does |
|:------|:-------------|
| `/one-on-one-meeting` | Structure and organize 1:1 meeting notes |
| `/writing-guide` | Consistent writing style and tone standards |

## Subagents — Multi-Step Workflows

For complex workflows, subagents orchestrate multiple skills end-to-end:

| Subagent | What it does | Example |
|:---------|:-------------|:--------|
| `/discovery-researcher` | Full CDH workflow: interviews → synthesis → opportunities → solutions → assumptions | `/discovery-researcher analyze these interview transcripts` |
| `/initiative-planner` | End-to-end planning: setup → 1-pager → PRD → design → tasks | `/initiative-planner set up checkout optimization` |
| `/strategy-reviewer` | Combined PRISM strategy + vision + OKR review | `/strategy-reviewer review our Q3 product strategy` |

## Migration from v1

This v2 release migrates from `.mdc` rules to the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io):
- `.mdc` files with `alwaysApply: false` → `.cursor/skills/[name]/SKILL.md`
- `.mdc` files with `alwaysApply: true` → `.cursor/rules/[name].mdc`
- Complex workflows → `.cursor/agents/[name].md` (Subagents)
- Legacy folders (`copilots/`, `frameworks/`, `guides/`) have been removed
