# üöÄ Cursor for Product Managers ü§ñ

Welcome to **Cursor for Product Managers**! This repository provides a comprehensive toolkit and framework designed to supercharge your product management workflow using Cursor as an AI-native PM copilot. Originally inspired by the [Maven course on AI-native PMs](https://maven.com/p/0a96cb/cursor-isn-t-just-for-coding-how-ai-native-p-ms-work) and the [AI Dev Tasks](https://github.com/snarktank/ai-dev-tasks/tree/main) structured workflow approach, this toolkit transforms Cursor from a coding tool into a powerful product thinking, strategic decision-making, and document creation platform.

Stop wrestling with fragmented product management tools and start building a unified, AI-powered PM workspace that grows smarter with every conversation!

## ‚ú® The Core Idea

Product management involves complex workflows across research, discovery, and delivery. This toolkit aims to bring structure, clarity, and AI-native efficiency to the process by:

1. **Unified Context Management**: Centralizing all PM knowledge, frameworks, and insights in one AI-accessible workspace
2. **Structured Discovery**: Leveraging proven frameworks like Continuous Discovery Habits for systematic user research
3. **AI-Native Workflows**: Using Cursor's capabilities for document-centric work, selective context, and visual diffs
4. **Iterative Improvement**: Building documents that grow smarter with every AI interaction

This approach helps ensure your AI copilot stays on track, makes it easier to manage complex product initiatives, and gives you confidence in AI-generated strategic content.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

### Company Level Context
- **Product Vision & Strategy**: Vision documents, strategy frameworks, and product principles
- **OKRs**: Objectives and Key Results tracking
- **Lesson Learned**: Insights and learnings from past initiatives
- **Team Structure**: Team organization and role definitions

### Frameworks
- **Continuous Discovery Habits**: Systematic user research and opportunity identification frameworks
- **Evidence-Guided**: Data-driven decision making frameworks and templates

### User Research
- **Interviews**: User interview snapshots and synthesis documents
- **App Store Reviews**: App store review analysis and insights
- **Research Archive**: Research methodology and historical data

### Initiatives
- Active product initiatives and project tracking

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Setup Your AI-Native PM Workspace

First, ensure you have Cursor installed and these framework files accessible:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local workspace
2. In Cursor's Agent chat, reference files with `@` (e.g., `@frameworks/continuous-discovery-habits/create-interview-snapshots.mdc`)
3. Follow the structured workflows for different PM activities

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Leverage AI Dev Tasks Framework

This toolkit integrates with the [AI Dev Tasks](https://github.com/snarktank/ai-dev-tasks/tree/main) structured workflow for complex product initiatives:

1. **Create PRDs**: Use AI to generate comprehensive Product Requirement Documents
2. **Break Down Tasks**: Decompose PRDs into actionable, granular task lists
3. **Iterative Implementation**: Guide AI through one task at a time with verification checkpoints
4. **Progress Tracking**: Visual representation of completed tasks and next steps

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Document-Centric Workflow

Instead of chat-based interactions, work directly in documents that grow smarter:

- **Selective Context**: Provide only necessary information to AI for focused assistance
- **Visual Diffs**: Clearly see AI-generated content changes and modifications
- **Continuous Learning**: Documents improve with every AI interaction and iteration

## üåü Key Benefits

* **Structured PM Workflow**: Enforces clear processes from research to delivery
* **AI-Native Efficiency**: Leverages Cursor's capabilities for PM-specific tasks
* **Context Preservation**: Maintains product context across all AI interactions
* **Framework Integration**: Built-in proven PM methodologies and frameworks
* **Iterative Improvement**: Documents and frameworks evolve with use
* **Unified Knowledge Base**: Single source of truth for all PM activities

## üõ†Ô∏è Framework Integration

### Continuous Discovery Habits
- **Interview Snapshots**: Structured templates for user research documentation
- **Opportunity Mapping**: Systematic approach to identifying product opportunities
- **Solution Generation**: AI-assisted ideation and solution development
- **Synthesis**: Research insights consolidation and pattern recognition

### Evidence-Guided Decision Making
- Data-driven frameworks for strategic decisions
- A/B testing templates and analysis tools
- User behavior analysis frameworks
- ROI calculation and measurement tools

## üí° Tips for Success

* **Be Specific**: Provide clear context and specific instructions to your AI copilot
* **Use MAX Mode**: For complex PRDs and strategic documents, consider using Cursor's MAX mode
* **Document Everything**: Build your knowledge base systematically through regular documentation
* **Iterate and Improve**: Use AI feedback to continuously enhance your frameworks and templates
* **Maintain Context**: Keep your AI copilot informed about your product strategy and goals

## üîß Cursor-Specific Features
