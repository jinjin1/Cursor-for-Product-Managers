# Rule: Generate Solutions (Continuous Discovery Habits)

## Goal
To generate multiple potential solutions for identified opportunities using Teresa Torres' Continuous Discovery Habits framework, then systematically evaluate and select the most promising approaches. This framework helps create diverse solutions through structured AI-human collaboration and ideation.

---

## When to Use
- After identifying clear opportunities using [Create Opportunities](./create-opportunities.mdc)
- When you have a well-defined target opportunity to solve
- Before committing to a single solution approach
- When you need to explore different solution directions
- After synthesizing user research findings

---

## Input
- **Primary Source**: Prioritized opportunities from `opportunities/`
- **Secondary Source**: Interview snapshots and synthesis documents
- **Minimum Requirements**: At least 1 target opportunity with supporting evidence

---

## Output
**Format:** Markdown (`.md`)  
**Location:** `solutions/`  
**Filename:** `solutions-[opportunity-name]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`  

---

## AI Instructions for Solution Generation

### When Receiving Opportunity Data
- **Validate Input Quality**: Check if opportunities are clearly defined with supporting evidence
- **Identify Solution Constraints**: Note technical, business, and user constraints
- **Request Additional Context**: Ask for more details about user needs and current solutions

### AI-Human Collaboration Guidelines
- **Act as Thinking Partner**: Engage in collaborative ideation, not just execution
- **Ask Probing Questions**: Challenge assumptions and explore different angles
- **Build on Ideas**: Use human's ideas to spark new thinking and variations
- **Maintain Focus**: Keep ideation centered on the target opportunity
- **Encourage Diversity**: Push for different types of solutions, not just variations

### Quality Standards
- **Problem Clarity**: Each solution clearly addresses the target opportunity
- **Evidence-Based**: Solutions grounded in user research and behavioral insights
- **Diverse Approaches**: Multiple solution types and implementation strategies
- **Actionable**: Solutions that can be realistically implemented

---

## Process

### 1. Review Your Target Opportunity
1. **Opportunity Alignment**: Ensure both AI and human understand the opportunity and context
2. **Opportunity Validation**: Confirm this is an appropriately sized leaf-node opportunity
3. **Context Review**: Review supporting evidence and user research findings
4. **Success Criteria**: Define what success looks like for this opportunity

---

### 2. Individual Ideation (Human)
1. **Solo Brainstorming**: Human generates initial ideas individually
2. **Overcome Blocks**: If stuck, take a break and try again
3. **Seek Inspiration**: Look to competitors or similar products for inspiration
4. **Think Broadly**: Don't limit to your industry - look at other domains solving similar problems
5. **Quantity Focus**: Aim for maximum quantity without judgment

---

### 3. AI-Human Collaborative Ideation
1. **Share Initial Ideas**: Human presents their ideas to AI
2. **AI Expansion**: AI builds on human ideas and generates variations
3. **Cross-Pollination**: AI suggests different approaches and categories
4. **Challenge Assumptions**: AI asks probing questions to explore new angles
5. **Iterative Refinement**: Multiple rounds of collaborative ideation

---

### 4. Repeat and Expand (Iterative Ideation)
1. **Multiple Rounds**: Continue individual and collaborative ideation sessions
2. **Cross-Pollination**: Use each other's ideas to generate more ideas
3. **Don't Skip Individual Work**: Continue solo ideation to maximize diversity
4. **Target Quantity**: Generate 15-20 ideas for your target opportunity
5. **Embrace Diversity**: First ideas aren't always best - seek variety and originality

---

### 5. Evaluate and Select Ideas
1. **Initial Filter**: Ask "Does this idea address the target opportunity?"
2. **Remove Irrelevant**: Filter out ideas that don't address the target opportunity
3. **Collaborative Evaluation**: AI and human discuss and evaluate ideas together
4. **Selection Criteria**: Focus on how well ideas address the target opportunity
5. **Select Top 3**: Choose the 3 most promising ideas through discussion
6. **Document Rationale**: Record why these 3 ideas were selected

---

## Common Antipatterns to Avoid

### 1. Not Including Diverse Perspectives
- **Problem**: Limiting ideation to single perspective or approach
- **Solution**: AI acts as diverse thinking partner, challenging assumptions
- **Why**: Diversity leads to more diverse ideas
- **Practice**: AI asks probing questions and suggests alternative approaches

### 2. Generating Too Many Variations of the Same Idea
- **Problem**: Focusing on variations rather than different approaches
- **Solution**: AI helps identify categorically different ideas
- **Why**: Diversity matters more than quantity when selecting final 3
- **Practice**: AI suggests different solution categories and approaches

### 3. Limiting Ideation to One Session
- **Problem**: Trying to generate all ideas in a single interaction
- **Solution**: Allow ideas to incubate over multiple sessions
- **Why**: Brain's problem-incubation capability is powerful
- **Practice**: Schedule multiple ideation sessions with breaks between

### 4. Selecting Ideas That Don't Address the Target Opportunity
- **Problem**: Getting distracted by interesting but irrelevant ideas
- **Solution**: AI helps maintain focus on target opportunity
- **Why**: Maintains focus on strategic decisions made during opportunity selection
- **Practice**: AI consistently asks "Does this idea address the target opportunity?"

---

## AI-Human Collaboration Techniques

### 1. AI Expansion Techniques
- **Build on Ideas**: Take human's idea and suggest variations or improvements
- **Cross-Category Thinking**: Suggest how idea could work in different contexts
- **Constraint Exploration**: Explore how idea could work with different constraints
- **Analogous Inspiration**: Suggest similar solutions from other domains

### 2. AI Challenge Techniques
- **Assumption Testing**: Question underlying assumptions in ideas
- **Perspective Shifting**: Ask "What if we looked at this differently?"
- **Constraint Addition**: Explore "What if we had to do this with [constraint]?"
- **User Perspective**: Ask "How would different user types experience this?"

### 3. AI Synthesis Techniques
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify common themes across ideas
- **Category Creation**: Group similar ideas and suggest missing categories
- **Gap Analysis**: Identify areas where no ideas have been generated
- **Combination Suggestions**: Propose combining elements from different ideas

---

## Solution Categories

### 1. Feature-Based Solutions

### Quality Issues
- **Solution-First Thinking**: Help reframe as problem-focused solutions
- **Assumption-Based Solutions**: Push for user research validation
- **Lack of Diversity**: Encourage different types of solutions
- **Off-Target Ideas**: Redirect focus to target opportunity

---

## Best Practices

### Do's
- Generate 15-20 ideas before selecting top 3
- Use AI as a thinking partner, not just an executor
- Allow ideas to incubate over multiple sessions
- Focus on ideas that address the target opportunity
- Collaborate iteratively between human and AI
- Build on each other's ideas
- Challenge assumptions and explore different angles

### Don'ts
- Don't limit ideation to one session
- Don't generate only variations of the same idea
- Don't include ideas that don't address the target opportunity
- Don't skip the individual ideation step
- Don't fall in love with your first solution
- Don't ignore AI's suggestions and challenges
- Don't assume you know what users want
