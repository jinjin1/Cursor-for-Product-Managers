# Rule: Generate Solutions (Continuous Discovery Habits)

## Goal
To generate multiple potential solutions for identified opportunities using Teresa Torres' Continuous Discovery Habits framework, then systematically evaluate and select the most promising approaches. This framework helps create diverse solutions through structured AI-human collaboration and ideation.

---

## When to Use
- After identifying clear opportunities using [Create Opportunities](./create-opportunities.mdc)
- When you have a well-defined target opportunity to solve
- Before committing to a single solution approach
- When you need to explore different solution directions
- After synthesizing user research findings

---

## Input

### Primary Input Sources (Choose One)
- **Option A**: Prioritized opportunities from `opportunities/` directory
- **Option B**: Direct opportunity input from user (ad-hoc opportunities)
- **Option C**: Mixed approach (file-based + direct input)

### Secondary Input Sources
- Interview snapshots and synthesis documents
- User research findings and behavioral insights
- Current solution limitations and pain points
- Business context and constraints

### Input Requirements
- **Minimum**: At least 1 target opportunity with supporting evidence
- **Ideal**: 3-5 opportunities for comparison and prioritization
- **Evidence**: User quotes, behavioral observations, or research data

### Flexible Input Handling
**When user provides direct opportunity input:**
1. **Validate Input Quality**: Ensure opportunity is clearly defined
2. **Request Supporting Evidence**: Ask for user quotes or behavioral data
3. **Extract Topic**: Analyze opportunity content for semantic filename
4. **File Existence Check**: MANDATORY - Check for existing files with pattern `solutions-[topic]-v*.md` before creating new file
5. **Version Management**: MANDATORY - Auto-increment version number based on existing files. Never overwrite existing files
6. **Proceed with Process**: Continue with standard solution generation

**When user provides mixed input:**
1. **Combine Sources**: Merge file-based and direct opportunities
2. **Prioritize**: Help user select target opportunity from combined list
3. **Standard Process**: Follow normal solution generation workflow

---

## Output
**Format:** Markdown (`.md`)  
**Location:** `solutions/[topic]/`  
**Filename:** `solutions-[topic]-v[version].md`

**Semantic Naming Guidelines:**
- topic: kebab-case topic name extracted from opportunity content (e.g., newsletter-creation, user-onboarding)
- version: auto-incrementing version number (v1, v2, v3...)
- Example: solutions-newsletter-creation-v1.md

**Version Management:**
- Check existing files with same topic pattern before creating new solutions
- Auto-increment version number (v1 → v2 → v3...)
- Never overwrite existing solution files
- Preserve all solution versions for comparison
- No date dependency required  

---

## AI Instructions for Solution Generation

### MANDATORY PROCESS ENFORCEMENT
**CRITICAL: AI MUST NOT SKIP STEP 2 (Individual Ideation)**

- **STEP 2 MANDATORY**: Request human to generate individual ideas first
- **VIOLATION PREVENTION**: If human requests solutions without Step 2, AI must:
  - STOP immediately
  - Explain: "Please generate at least 3 individual ideas first (recommended: 10-15 ideas)"
  - Wait for human's ideas before proceeding
  - Do NOT generate solutions until Step 2 is completed

### Input Validation and Processing
**When receiving opportunity data:**
- **Validate Input Quality**: Check if opportunities are clearly defined with supporting evidence
- **Identify Solution Constraints**: Note technical, business, and user constraints
- **Request Additional Context**: Ask for more details about user needs and current solutions
- **Topic Extraction**: Analyze opportunity content to extract main topic for semantic filename

**For direct opportunity input:**
- **Clarify Context**: Ask for user segments, timing, and current solutions
- **Request Evidence**: Ask for specific user quotes or behavioral observations
- **Validate Scope**: Ensure opportunity is appropriately sized (leaf-node level)
- **Extract Topic**: Analyze opportunity content for semantic filename

### AI-Human Collaboration Guidelines
- **MANDATORY WAIT**: Never generate solutions before human completes individual ideation
- **Build on Human Ideas**: Use human's ideas as foundation, not starting point
- **Ask Probing Questions**: "What if we looked at this differently?" "How might different user types experience this?"
- **Expand and Vary**: Take human's ideas and suggest variations, improvements, and alternatives
- **Cross-Pollination**: Suggest how ideas could work in different contexts or domains
- **Maintain Focus**: Keep ideation centered on the target opportunity
- **Encourage Diversity**: Push for different types of solutions, not just variations

### Quality Standards
- **Problem Clarity**: Each solution clearly addresses the target opportunity
- **Evidence-Based**: Solutions grounded in user research and behavioral insights
- **Diverse Approaches**: Multiple solution types and implementation strategies
- **Actionable**: Solutions that can be realistically implemented

### Semantic File Naming Guidelines
- **Topic Extraction**: Analyze opportunity content to identify main topic/theme
- **Filename Format**: Use semantic naming pattern `solutions-[topic]-v[version].md`
- **Version Management**: Auto-increment version number based on existing files
- **Folder Organization**: Create topic-specific subfolders for better organization
- **No Date Dependency**: Remove all date-based filename requirements

**Topic Extraction Process:**
1. Analyze opportunity document for main theme and keywords
2. Identify the most relevant topic/theme from opportunity content
3. Convert to kebab-case format (e.g., "Newsletter Creation" → "newsletter-creation")
4. Ensure topic uniqueness across different solution files
5. Use topic as primary identifier instead of date

**Version Management Process:**
1. **MANDATORY STEP 1:** Check existing files with pattern `solutions-[topic]-v*.md`
2. **MANDATORY STEP 2:** Find the highest version number for the same topic
3. **MANDATORY STEP 3:** Auto-increment version number (v1 → v2 → v3...)
4. **MANDATORY STEP 4:** Generate new filename with incremented version
5. **MANDATORY STEP 5:** Verify no file with new filename exists before creation
6. **CRITICAL:** Never overwrite existing files - always create new version
7. No manual version tracking required

**Smart Topic Detection:**
- **Content Analysis**: Extract main themes from opportunity document
- **Keyword Frequency**: Use most frequent relevant keywords as topic
- **Kebab-Case Format**: Convert spaces to hyphens, lowercase (e.g., "User Onboarding" → "user-onboarding")
- **Uniqueness Check**: Ensure topic doesn't conflict with existing files
- **Fallback**: Use generic topic name if extraction fails

---

## Process

### 0) File Management (MANDATORY PRE-STEP)
1. **Extract topic** from opportunity document or direct input
2. **Check existing files** with pattern `solutions-[topic]-v*.md` in target directory
3. **Find highest version** number for same topic (e.g., if v1, v2 exist, next is v3)
4. **Generate new filename** with incremented version: `solutions-[topic]-v[version].md`
5. **Verify no file exists** with new filename before proceeding
6. **CRITICAL**: Never overwrite existing files - always create new version

### 1. Review Your Target Opportunity
1. **Opportunity Alignment**: Ensure both AI and human understand the opportunity and context
2. **Opportunity Validation**: Confirm this is an appropriately sized leaf-node opportunity
3. **Context Review**: Review supporting evidence and user research findings
4. **Success Criteria**: Define what success looks like for this opportunity

**For direct input opportunities:**
- **Clarify Details**: Ask for user segments, timing, and current solutions
- **Request Evidence**: Ask for specific user quotes or behavioral observations
- **Validate Scope**: Ensure opportunity is appropriately sized

---

### 2. Individual Ideation (Human) - MANDATORY
1. **Solo Brainstorming**: Human generates initial ideas individually
2. **Overcome Blocks**: If stuck, take a break and try again
3. **Seek Inspiration**: Look to competitors or similar products for inspiration
4. **Think Broadly**: Don't limit to your industry - look at other domains solving similar problems
5. **Quantity Focus**: Aim for maximum quantity without judgment
6. **Target**: Generate **minimum 3 individual ideas** before proceeding
   - **Recommended**: 10-15 ideas for better diversity and quality
   - **Time-constrained**: 3-5 ideas acceptable for quick iterations

**AI MUST WAIT**: Do not proceed to Step 3 until human completes this step

---

### 3. AI-Human Collaborative Ideation
1. **Share Initial Ideas**: Human presents their ideas to AI
2. **AI Expansion**: AI builds on human ideas and generates variations
3. **Cross-Pollination**: AI suggests different approaches and categories
4. **Challenge Assumptions**: AI asks probing questions to explore new angles
5. **Iterative Refinement**: Multiple rounds of collaborative ideation

---

### 4. Repeat and Expand (Iterative Ideation)
1. **Multiple Rounds**: Continue individual and collaborative ideation sessions
2. **Cross-Pollination**: Use each other's ideas to generate more ideas
3. **Don't Skip Individual Work**: Continue solo ideation to maximize diversity
4. **Target Quantity**: Generate 15-20 ideas for your target opportunity
5. **Embrace Diversity**: First ideas aren't always best - seek variety and originality

---

### 5. Evaluate and Select Ideas
1. **Initial Filter**: Ask "Does this idea address the target opportunity?"
2. **Remove Irrelevant**: Filter out ideas that don't address the target opportunity
3. **Collaborative Evaluation**: AI and human discuss and evaluate ideas together
4. **Selection Criteria**: Focus on how well ideas address the target opportunity
5. **Select Top 3**: Choose the 3 most promising ideas through discussion
6. **Document Rationale**: Record why these 3 ideas were selected

- **Step 5**: Collaborative evaluation and selection completed

**Note**: These checkpoints are recommended for quality assurance but not mandatory for basic usage.

---

## Common Antipatterns to Avoid

### 1. Not Including Diverse Perspectives
- **Problem**: Limiting ideation to single perspective or approach
- **Solution**: AI acts as diverse thinking partner, challenging assumptions
- **Why**: Diversity leads to more diverse ideas
- **Practice**: AI asks probing questions and suggests alternative approaches

### 2. Generating Too Many Variations of the Same Idea
- **Problem**: Focusing on variations rather than different approaches
- **Solution**: AI helps identify categorically different ideas
- **Why**: Diversity matters more than quantity when selecting final 3
- **Practice**: AI suggests different solution categories and approaches

### 3. Limiting Ideation to One Session
- **Problem**: Trying to generate all ideas in a single interaction
- **Solution**: Allow ideas to incubate over multiple sessions
- **Why**: Brain's problem-incubation capability is powerful
- **Practice**: Schedule multiple ideation sessions with breaks between

### 4. Selecting Ideas That Don't Address the Target Opportunity
- **Problem**: Getting distracted by interesting but irrelevant ideas
- **Solution**: AI helps maintain focus on target opportunity
- **Why**: Maintains focus on strategic decisions made during opportunity selection
- **Practice**: AI consistently asks "Does this idea address the target opportunity?"

---

## AI-Human Collaboration Techniques

### 1. AI Expansion Techniques
- **Build on Ideas**: Take human's idea and suggest variations or improvements
- **Cross-Category Thinking**: Suggest how idea could work in different contexts
- **Constraint Exploration**: Explore how idea could work with different constraints
- **Analogous Inspiration**: Suggest similar solutions from other domains

### 2. AI Challenge Techniques
- **Assumption Testing**: Question underlying assumptions in ideas
- **Perspective Shifting**: Ask "What if we looked at this differently?"
- **Constraint Addition**: Explore "What if we had to do this with [constraint]?"
- **User Perspective**: Ask "How would different user types experience this?"

### 3. AI Synthesis Techniques
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify common themes across ideas
- **Category Creation**: Group similar ideas and suggest missing categories
- **Gap Analysis**: Identify areas where no ideas have been generated
- **Combination Suggestions**: Propose combining elements from different ideas
