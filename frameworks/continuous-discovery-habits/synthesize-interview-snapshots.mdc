# Rules: Synthesize Interview Snapshots

## Overview
This framework guides you through analyzing multiple interview snapshots to identify common patterns, integrate individual experience maps, and create comprehensive insights that reveal shared user needs and opportunities. It transforms individual data points into actionable patterns that inform product decisions.

## When to Use
- After completing multiple interviews on the same topic or user journey
- When you need to identify shared patterns across different user segments
- Before creating opportunities or generating solutions
- When sharing research findings with stakeholders
- When you have conflicting or unclear insights from individual interviews

## Output
**Format:** Markdown (`.md`)  
**Location:** `user-interviews/synthesis/[topic]/`  
**Filename:** `synthesis-[topic]-v[version].md`

**Semantic Naming Guidelines:**
- topic: kebab-case topic name extracted from content analysis (e.g., newsletter-creation, user-onboarding)
- version: auto-incrementing version number (v1, v2, v3...)
- Example: synthesis-newsletter-creation-v1.md

**Version Management:**
- Check existing files with same topic pattern before creating new synthesis
- Auto-increment version number (v1 → v2 → v3...)
- Never overwrite existing synthesis files
- Preserve all synthesis versions for comparison
- No date dependency required

---

## Input Validation
**Prerequisites:** 
- [ ] Minimum 3-5 interview snapshots completed using [Create Interview Snapshots](./create-interview-snapshots.mdc)

## AI Instructions for Synthesis

### When Receiving Multiple Snapshots
- **Validate Input Quality**: Check if snapshots meet minimum standards from create-interview-snapshots.mdc
- **Identify Research Gaps**: Note missing information that could strengthen synthesis
- **Request Additional Data**: Ask for missing snapshots if sample size is insufficient
- **Topic Extraction**: Analyze content to extract main topic for semantic filename

### Incremental Synthesis Process (Efficiency Optimization)
- **Check for Existing Synthesis**: Look for previous synthesis files in the same topic area
- **Identify New Snapshots**: Compare current snapshots with those already processed in existing synthesis
- **Process Only New Data**: If existing synthesis found, analyze only new snapshots and merge with existing patterns
- **Update Existing Synthesis**: Enhance previous synthesis with new insights rather than starting from scratch
- **Full Synthesis Only When**: No existing synthesis found, or significant topic shift detected

### Semantic File Naming Guidelines
- **Topic Extraction**: Analyze interview content to identify main topic/theme
- **Filename Format**: Use semantic naming pattern `synthesis-[topic]-v[version].md`
- **Version Management**: Auto-increment version number based on existing files
- **Document Date Range**: Use actual interview date range (e.g., 2025-09-01 - 2025-09-07)
- **Folder Organization**: Create topic-specific subfolders for better organization
- **No Date Dependency**: Remove all date-based filename requirements

**Topic Extraction Process:**
1. Analyze interview snapshots for common themes and keywords
2. Identify the most frequent and relevant topic/theme
3. Convert to kebab-case format (e.g., "Newsletter Creation" → "newsletter-creation")
4. Ensure topic uniqueness across different synthesis files
5. Use topic as primary identifier instead of date

**Version Management Process:**
1. Check existing files with pattern `synthesis-[topic]-v*.md`
2. Find the highest version number for the same topic
3. Auto-increment version number (v1 → v2 → v3...)
4. Generate new filename with incremented version
5. No manual version tracking required

**Smart Topic Detection:**
- **Content Analysis**: Extract main themes from interview snapshots
- **Keyword Frequency**: Use most frequent relevant keywords as topic
- **Kebab-Case Format**: Convert spaces to hyphens, lowercase (e.g., "User Onboarding" → "user-onboarding")
- **Uniqueness Check**: Ensure topic doesn't conflict with existing files
- **Fallback**: Use generic topic name if extraction fails

### Pattern Recognition Guidelines
- **Focus on Behavioral Patterns**: Look for concrete actions, not opinions
- **Identify Emotional Journeys**: Map frustration, delight, confusion patterns
- **Document Workarounds**: Note how users currently solve problems
- **Preserve Context**: Maintain when/where/why details from individual stories

### Quality Standards
- **Evidence Strength**: Multiple participants supporting each pattern
- **Behavioral Specificity**: Concrete examples, not generalizations
- **Segment Clarity**: Clear understanding of user group differences
- **Actionable Insights**: Patterns that inform product decisions

- **Where**: In what environments or situations?
- **Why**: What triggers or causes this behavior?

---

## Key Principles

### 1. Preserve Individual Stories
- **Goal**: Find shared patterns while maintaining specific details
- **Approach**: Look for commonalities without losing individual insights
- **Practice**: Ask "What do these stories have in common?" and "How do they differ?"

### 2. Focus on Pattern Integration
- **Structure**: Organize around shared experiences and variations
- **Flow**: Show how patterns emerge across different users
- **Context**: Include thoughts, feelings, and pain points at each stage

### 3. Evidence-Based Synthesis
- **Support**: Every insight should have supporting quotes or observations
- **Frequency**: Note how often patterns appear
- **Variations**: Document differences between user segments

### 4. Actionable Outputs
- **Opportunities**: Specific problems worth solving
- **Insights**: Understanding that informs product decisions
- **Next Steps**: Clear actions for research and product teams

---

## Quality Indicators

### Strong Evidence
- **Multiple Sources**: Same insight from different users
- **Consistent Patterns**: Similar behaviors across interviews
- **Specific Examples**: Concrete stories and quotes
- **Contextual Detail**: Rich understanding of when/why

### Weak Evidence
- **Single Source**: Only one user mentioned this
- **Vague Patterns**: General statements without specifics
- **Assumptions**: What you think vs. what users said
- **Over-Generalization**: Losing important details

---

## Error Handling

### Insufficient Data
- **Too Few Snapshots**: Request additional interviews before synthesis
- **Incomplete Snapshots**: Ask for missing information or re-interview
- **Poor Quality Data**: Suggest improvements to interview process

### Pattern Recognition Issues
- **No Clear Patterns**: Indicate need for more interviews or different approach
- **Conflicting Evidence**: Document contradictions and request clarification
- **Weak Evidence**: Highlight areas needing stronger support

### Quality Issues
- **Over-Generalization**: Push for specific behavioral examples
- **Missing Context**: Request additional details from original interviews
- **Unclear Variations**: Ask for better segment differentiation

### File Naming Issues
- **Topic Extraction Failure**: Ensure clear topic identification from content analysis
- **Version Conflicts**: Always check existing files before creating new synthesis
- **Incorrect Format**: Use kebab-case for topic, v[number] for version
- **Missing Topic**: Extract main theme from interview snapshots for filename
- **Overwriting Prevention**: Never overwrite existing synthesis files, always increment version

---

## Common Synthesis Mistakes

### 1. Losing Individual Stories
- **Problem**: Over-generalizing to the point of losing specific insights
- **Solution**: Maintain balance between patterns and details
- **Practice**: Ask "What specific examples support this pattern?"

### 2. Ignoring Segment Differences
- **Problem**: Assuming all users follow the same journey
- **Solution**: Document variations by user segment
- **Practice**: Ask "How do different user types behave differently?"

### 3. Skipping Context
- **Problem**: Focusing only on actions without thoughts/feelings
- **Solution**: Include emotional and cognitive context at each stage
- **Practice**: Ask "What are users thinking and feeling at this stage?"

### 4. Confirmation Bias
- **Problem**: Only seeing what confirms your assumptions
- **Solution**: Actively look for contradictory evidence
- **Practice**: Ask "What would disprove this insight?"

### 5. Jumping to Solutions
- **Problem**: Moving too quickly from insights to solutions
- **Solution**: Stay in the problem space longer
- **Practice**: Ask "What else do we need to understand?"

### 6. Topic Extraction Confusion
- **Problem**: Using vague or incorrect topic names for filename
- **Solution**: Clear topic extraction process from content analysis
- **Practice**: Always analyze interview content to identify main theme before creating filename

---

## Best Practices

### Do's
- **TOPIC EXTRACTION**: Always analyze content to extract clear topic for semantic filename
- **EFFICIENCY FIRST**: Check for existing synthesis before starting new analysis
- **INCREMENTAL PROCESSING**: Process only new snapshots when updating existing synthesis
- Synthesize after multiple interviews on the same topic
- Focus on finding common patterns across individual stories
- Document variations by user segment
- Include supporting evidence for all insights
- Use the synthesis to identify opportunities
- Look for patterns, not just individual stories
- Document your synthesis process and reasoning
- Share findings with stakeholders for validation
- Use semantic naming: synthesis-[topic]-v[version].md format
- Extract main theme from interview content for topic identification
- Check existing files before creating new synthesis
- Auto-increment version number for same-topic syntheses
- Preserve all synthesis versions for comparison
- **TRACK PROCESSED SNAPSHOTS**: Always note which snapshots were included in each synthesis
- **MERGE STRATEGICALLY**: Integrate new insights with existing patterns rather than starting over

### Don'ts
- Don't synthesize too early (before patterns emerge)
- Don't lose individual story details in generalization
- Don't ignore contradictory evidence
- Don't assume one user represents all users
- Don't skip the synthesis step to save time
- **NEVER**: Create synthesis filename without extracting clear topic from content
- Don't use vague or generic topic names for filename
- Don't use inconsistent naming formats
- Don't overwrite existing synthesis files
- Don't skip version number checking
- Don't guess or assume topic without content analysis
- **AVOID**: Re-processing snapshots that were already analyzed in previous synthesis
- **DON'T**: Start from scratch when updating existing synthesis with new snapshots
- **AVOID**: Full re-synthesis unless significant topic shift or 5+ new snapshots
