# Rule: Extracting Insights from Qualitative Interviews and User Tests (Continuous Discovery Habits)

## Goal
To guide an AI assistant in systematically extracting meaningful insights from qualitative interviews or user test sessions, creating structured interview snapshots that capture specific stories, opportunities, and behavioral insights following the Continuous Discovery Habits methodology.

## Output
**Format:** Markdown (`.md`)  
**Location:** `user-interviews/snapshots/`  
**Filename:** `snapshot-[participant-name]-[date].md`

## Process
1. **Data Validation**: Assess the completeness and quality of provided interview data
2. **Context Extraction**: Identify session type, research goals, and participant context
3. **Story Identification**: Extract specific behavioral stories, not generalizations
4. **Experience Mapping**: Create user journey maps for key stories
5. **Opportunity Analysis**: Identify pain points, needs, and improvement areas
6. **Insight Synthesis**: Recognize patterns and behavioral insights
7. **Snapshot Creation**: Compile into structured interview snapshot
8. **Quality Review**: Validate completeness and clarity

## AI Instructions

### When Receiving Interview Data
- **Ask clarifying questions** if data is incomplete or ambiguous
- **Request specific examples** if only general statements are provided
- **Confirm participant context** if demographic or behavioral details are missing
- **Validate research goals** to ensure alignment with snapshot objectives

### Data Processing Guidelines
- **Focus on concrete behaviors** over opinions or intentions
- **Extract contextual details** (when, where, with whom, why)
- **Identify emotional moments** (frustration, delight, surprise, confusion)
- **Capture workarounds** and problem-solving approaches
- **Note repeated patterns** that indicate systematic issues

### Quality Standards
- **Completeness**: All required sections must be filled
- **Specificity**: Use concrete examples, not generalizations
- **Clarity**: Write in clear, actionable language
- **Consistency**: Follow established format and structure
- **Insight Value**: Each insight should be actionable or informative

### Optional Sections
- **Follow-up Questions**: Additional research needed
- **Related Research**: Connections to other studies or findings
- **Stakeholder Notes**: Implications for different teams or roles

## Interaction Model

### 1. Data Input Phase
- User provides interview transcript, notes, or observations
- AI assesses data completeness and requests clarification if needed
- AI confirms research context and objectives

### 2. Processing Phase
- AI systematically extracts stories and behavioral insights
- AI creates structured experience maps
- AI identifies opportunities and patterns

### 3. Review Phase
- AI presents draft snapshot for user review
- User provides feedback and requests modifications
- AI iterates and improves based on feedback

### 4. Finalization Phase
- AI saves completed snapshot to specified location
- AI confirms file creation and provides summary

## Error Handling

### Incomplete Data
- **Missing Context**: Ask for session type, participant background, or research goals
- **Vague Responses**: Request specific examples or concrete details
- **Limited Stories**: Probe for additional behavioral examples

### Ambiguous Information
- **Multiple Interpretations**: Present alternatives and ask for clarification
- **Unclear Relationships**: Request additional context or examples
- **Conflicting Data**: Highlight inconsistencies and ask for resolution

### Quality Issues
- **Generalizations**: Push for specific behavioral examples
- **Opinions vs. Behaviors**: Distinguish between what people say vs. what they do
- **Missing Emotions**: Probe for emotional responses and reactions

## Quality Assurance Checklist

### Before Finalizing
- [ ] All required sections are complete
- [ ] Stories contain concrete behavioral details
- [ ] Experience map follows logical flow
- [ ] Opportunities are specific and actionable
- [ ] Insights go beyond individual stories
- [ ] Quotes are accurate and representative
- [ ] Context is clear and complete

### Validation Questions
- Would a product team member understand this insight?
- Is there enough detail to take action?
- Does this capture the participant's actual behavior?
- Are the opportunities specific enough to prioritize?

## Best Practices

### Story Extraction
- Ask "Tell me about the last time you..." to get specific instances
- Focus on recent experiences for accuracy
- Capture the sequence of actions, not just outcomes
- Note what participants actually did vs. what they intended

### Experience Mapping
- Start with clear boundaries (what triggers the journey, what defines success)
- Focus on concrete actions and decisions
- Include emotional states and pain points
- Map the complete journey, not just the happy path

### Opportunity Identification
- Connect opportunities to specific stories and behaviors
- Consider both explicit needs and implicit frustrations
- Evaluate impact and feasibility
- Prioritize based on frequency and severity
