## Experience Map
*A text-based, visual representation of the participant's journey for a specific story. Focus on concrete actions and context, not generalizations.*

**Scope:** [Define the start and end points of the map, e.g., "From deciding to apply for a job to submitting the application"]  
**Goal:** [The participant's desired outcome, e.g., "To successfully apply for the Senior Product Manager role"]

**Journey:**
1.  **Stage 1: [Stage title]**
    - **Actions:** [What the user did, e.g., "Heard about the show from a friend."]
    - **Thoughts/Feelings:** [Quotes or paraphrased emotions, e.g., "This sounds great!"]
    - **Pain Points:** [Specific frustrations or challenges, e.g., "Forgot the name of the show later."]
2.  **Stage 2: [Stage title]**
    - **Actions:** [e.g., "Opened Netflix on their TV and used the search bar."]
    - **Thoughts/Feelings:** [e.g., "Where do I find this? Is it on this platform?"]
    - **Pain Points:** [e.g., "Couldn't find the show with the keywords he remembered."]
3.  **Stage 3: [Stage title]**
    - **Actions:** [e.g., "Finally found the movie and started watching."]
    - **Thoughts/Feelings:** [e.g., "Relieved to have found it."]
    - **Pain Points:** [e.g., "The streaming quality was poor at the beginning."]

*(Add or remove stages as necessary to map the complete, specific experience)*

## Opportunities
- [Potential improvement or unmet need #1]  
- [Potential improvement or unmet need #2]  

---

## Insights
- [Patterns that go beyond a single story, e.g., user mental models, decision-making shortcuts, systemic frustrations]  


## Process
1. **Receive Interview Data:** User provides interview transcript, recording notes, or user test observations  
2. **Identify Context:** Determine the type of session (discovery interview, usability test, etc.) and research goals  
3. **Extract Stories:** Identify specific stories about actual behavior, not generalizations  
4. **Map Experiences:** Create a simple experience map of the participant's journey  
5. **Identify Opportunities:** Extract needs, pain points, and desires expressed in the stories  
6. **Capture Insights:** Note interesting behaviors or patterns that may not yet be opportunities  
7. **Create Snapshot:** Compile all elements into an interview snapshot  
8. **Save Document:** Save in `/user-research/interviews/snapshots/` directory


## Story Extraction Guidelines
- Ask for **specific instances** (“Tell me about the last time you…”).  
- Capture **actual behaviors** rather than speculative intentions.  
- Note **contextual details** (when, where, with whom).  
- Highlight **emotional moments** (frustration, delight, surprises).  
- Favor **recent experiences** to ensure accuracy.
